/**
 * Durable repository adapters for production deployments.
 * Contract: implementations must be server-side only and not expose credentials.
 *
 * NOTE: Specific backend choice (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.) is implementation-specific.
 * This file provides the interface and placeholder for future backend adapters.
 *
 * ── Count-maintenance decision (issue #136) ──────────────────────────────────
 * Guild.memberCount / Guild.passCount are DERIVED AT READ, not maintained
 * incrementally. On every getAll / getById the guild record's counts are
 * recomputed from the injected member and pass repositories, which are the
 * source of truth. Rationale:
 *
 *   - Correct by construction. A denormalized counter maintained by hand can
 *     drift if any write path forgets to update it or if two concurrent
 *     create/delete operations interleave. Deriving the value on read makes
 *     drift impossible: the number is always whatever the member/pass repos
 *     actually contain.
 *   - The Member and Pass types carry no guildId foreign key (see mock-data.ts):
 *     this dashboard models a single workspace, so a guild's counts reflect the
 *     total membership / pass supply of the workspace. There is no per-guild
 *     partition to sum, which makes read-time derivation both simple and exact.
 *   - Tradeoff: each read pays for a getAll on members and passes. For the
 *     in-memory adapter this is an O(n) Map scan and negligible. A future SQL
 *     backend can swap this for an indexed COUNT(*) or a maintained counter
 *     without changing the public contract.
 *
 * Writes to the guild store (create / update / delete) are serialized through a
 * per-instance async mutex so concurrent mutations cannot interleave and leave a
 * guild record half-written. Because counts are derived rather than stored, the
 * mutex protects only the guild record itself, not the counters.
